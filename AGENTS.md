# Agent Operating Notes

- After every change, update README.md with the current state and outstanding issues.
- Always finish by creating a git commit summarising the work.
- Run at least the targeted math unit suite (mvn -pl syntax-markdown-commonmark12 -Dtest=MarkdownMathBasicTest test -DskipITs) before handing results back.
