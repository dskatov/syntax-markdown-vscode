# Distribution Artifacts

Milestone-tagged release bundles for CommonMark VSCode Markdown live here. Each subfolder is named after a git tag and stores the shaded binary plus human notes.

- commonmark-vscode-0.1/: first milestone with the placeholder pipeline, includes syntax-markdown-commonmark-vscode-16.5.0-vscode0.1.jar.

Grab the jar you need from the desired milestone folder or bind-mount it directly in Docker as documented in ../README.md.
