# Distribution Artifacts

Milestone-tagged release bundles for Markdown With Math live here. Each subfolder is named after a git tag and stores the shaded binary plus human notes.

- math-milestone-aurora/: first milestone with the placeholder pipeline, includes syntax-markdown-math10-16.5.0-math1.0.jar.

Grab the jar you need from the desired milestone folder or bind-mount it directly in Docker as documented in ../README.md.
