# Distribution Artifacts

Published jars grouped by milestone tags live here. Each subfolder is named after a git tag and contains the shaded bundle for that release plus any accompanying notes.

- math-milestone-aurora/: first pass with math placeholders, includes syntax-markdown-math10-16.5.0-math1.0.jar.

Copy the jar you need from the appropriate milestone folder, or bind-mount it directly in Docker as documented in syntax-markdown/README.md.
